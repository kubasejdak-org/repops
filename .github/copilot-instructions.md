# General guidelines

- Act as a senior software engineer.
- Use best coding standards for each programming language that you have to use.
- Do not duplicate code. If you have to add similar functionality more than once, then extract it into a separate module
  or function and reuse.
- Do not add comments for obvious things. Add them where code is complicated or solution may be less known.
- Respond without being super polite. Stick to the facts.
- Keep generated files under 500 lines of code if possible.
