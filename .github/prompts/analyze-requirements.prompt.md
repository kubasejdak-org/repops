Your goal is to clarify project requirements so they are simple, consistent and unambiguous.

- Analyze project requirements in #file:../../docs and tell me what do you not understand in it.
- Are there any ambiguities, missing details or contradictions?
- List all issues you found in the requirements.
- Then ask me questions to clarify each issue one by one and update requirements to reflect my answers. Wait for my
  answer after each question. Skip issue if I don't know how to answer now. Keep asking until each issue is resolved.
