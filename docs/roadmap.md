### ðŸŸ¡ Next: Phase 2 Implementation

Ready to begin **Phase 2: Operation Framework & Base Operations** which will add:

- Operation system with base classes and context sharing

- File operations (find, replace with pattern matching)
- Script execution operations
- Foundation for pipeline system

The codebase is well-structured and thoroughly tested manually. All Phase 1 functionality works correctly with proper error handling and user-friendly output.
